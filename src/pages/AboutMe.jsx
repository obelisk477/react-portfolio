            My trajectory as a developer has been a storied one. 
            It started with learning to program my calculator in TI-BASIC in high school (to do my homework for me), and now I'm in full-stack development. 
            In between though, I was a coffee roaster, a seminary student, a waiter, and a digital marketer.
            But I think in some ways I was always going to end up here. 
            Even in between having kids, going to graduate school, and working at a coffee startup, I was always tinkering with code. 
            In the meantime, I built a neural network to help find ergonomic Rubik's cube algorithms, created a Chrome extension to automate my marketing job, 
            and built Shopify API connections in Python to help automate a small business. And now -- I plan on coding every day!
